BUGS

making event when not showing shadow boids does enable showing of shadow
boids, but does NOT place a marker in the plot


stat lines are y-spaced based on screen-space metric, not actual line height


TODOs


color boids by component?

make configurable (config file/python script) for collab:
- font size
- boid point size and color (3D and top/side view)
- background color
- plot sizes
- fullscreen yes/no
- number of historic values kept
- top/side view sizes
