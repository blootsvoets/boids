BUGS

making event when not showing shadow boids does enable showing of shadow
boids, but does NOT place a marker in the plot

when showing bird model pausing animation causes birds not to get rendered


stat lines are y-spaced based on screen-space metric, not actual line height


TODOs

use TextDrawer in other places

color boids by component?

make configurable (config file/python script) for collab:
- font size (hmm, we use the fixed GLUT fonts, which do not really have large sizes)


IDEAS

click on top/side view, switch perspective to closest bird?
