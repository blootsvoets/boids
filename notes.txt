BUGS

making event when not showing shadow boids does enable showing of shadow
boids, but does NOT place a marker in the plot


show shadow boids in side/top views?
make points smaller?


overrotating the camera results in annoying inversion of the 
other rotation axis


TODOs


show components in different colors when # > 1?

plot # of components
